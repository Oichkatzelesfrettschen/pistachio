Build Requirements
==================

This repository ships a lightweight `configure` script in the `user`
directory.  A POSIX shell and a compiler supporting the `-std=c23`
option are sufficient.  Detailed kernel and user land instructions are
available in `../docs/building.md`.

To prepare the build simply invoke the script from a build directory:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../user/configure

After the script finishes you can continue with the instructions in the
`INSTALL` file.
