We are building and running STD+WS+nfs kernels, but there is
still a chance of a deadlock with this kernel which can occur
even if you are not using the NFS code.

^Z from emacs still not right, but the rest of the signal problems
appear to be solved.

Baud rates from kernel to server have been fixed.

There are still a few problems in building the server under the BNR
environment. The mksyscalls script fails, the as of emulator/i386/emul_vector.s
fails and we need to be able to load the BSD format executables as well
as the Mach ones.
