L4Ka::Pistachio is the latest L4 microkernel developed by the System
Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe in collaboration
with the DiSy group at the University of New South Wales,
Australia. It is the first available kernel implementation of the L4
Version 4 kernel API (currently code-named Version X.2), which is
fully 32 and 64 bit clean, provides multiprocessor support, and
super-fast local IPC.

Building with modern compilers
==============================

The build system now expects a compiler that understands the C23
language standard. GCC 14 and Clang 17 are known to work. Autoconf
2.69 or later is required to regenerate the configure script.

Example build steps on a typical Linux host::

    $ cd user
    $ autoreconf -i        # requires autoconf and autoheader
    $ ./configure --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu   # or x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
    $ make

When building the kernel choose either `SUBARCH=x32` for i686 or
`SUBARCH=x64` for x86_64 in `kernel/Makeconf.local` before invoking
`make` inside the build directory.
