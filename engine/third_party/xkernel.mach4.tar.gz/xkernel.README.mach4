X-kernel port to Mach4 (Utah Flexmach)

I am building an SNMP controlled soft drink machine as part of my
master's thesis. The purpose is to study the possibilities of
SNMP-controlled hardware. 

For the operating system platform my advisor Pekka Nikander
(pnr@nixu.fi) seleted the Mach microkernel system. Since Mach has
no network support in the kernel, we decided to use the X-Kernel
as the UDP/IP stack.

This package contains the University of Arizona X-kernel v3.2 and
my changes to it, to allow it to run under Mach4 as a Mach task
(not as an Unix process and not in kernel). 

The changes have been made here and there and not in an
especially nice way. So it works for me, you can have what I have
done, If I get time I might try to document it better, but you
are pretty much on your own.
