This directory contains a modified version of RMGR. RMGR is part of
DROPS, a project of University of Dresden's Operating Systems Group.
DROPS is published under GPL as is this version of RMGR.

Among the modifications mentioned above are:
o adaptation to L4 Version X.0 interface
o handling of L4/Ka kernels
o -maxmem option
o -roottask option

Actually, RMGR links against OSKit libraries and the OSKit support
library of DROPS. However, we prefer to include these libs in binary
format to avoid having to build OSKit and half of DROPS to get just
RMGR. Sources of these libs are available on the DROPS download site.
